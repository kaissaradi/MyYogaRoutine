            <h2>Warm-Up: Seated Poses</h2>

            <h3>1. Easy Seat with Breath Work</h3>
            <div class="placeholder">Image placeholder</div>
            <p class="short-desc">Begin in a comfortable seated position. Focus on your breath, inhaling deeply and exhaling slowly. <span class="read-more">Read More</span></p>
            <p class="detailed-desc" style="display: none;">Sit cross-legged on the floor with a straight spine, shoulders relaxed. Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your abdomen to expand, and exhale fully, feeling your body relax with each breath. Continue this for several minutes to center your mind and prepare your body for the practice.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Knee Circles</h3>
            <p>Plant your feet on the floor with knees bent. Slowly let your knees fall to the sides on an exhale, and bring them back in on the inhale. Repeat a few times to loosen the hips.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Leg Swings</h3>
            <p>Pick up one leg, clasp your hands under the thigh, and gently swing the leg side to side. This reminds your brain of the knee's range of motion. Switch sides and repeat.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Supine Leg Stretch</h3>
            <p>Lie on your back. Extend one leg and clasp your hands behind the bent leg. Inhale, and on every exhale, switch legs. Repeat 5 times.</p>
            <div class="tip p-2 bg-warning rounded">Tip: For an extra challenge, keep the extended leg floating above the floor.</div>
            
            <h3>5. Waterfall Pose</h3>
            <div class="placeholder">Image placeholder</div>
            <p>Start in bridge pose with a block under your lower back. Float your legs up to the sky. "Floss" the nerve by pointing and flexing your feet.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Bridge Pose</h3>
            <p>Remove the block and stay in bridge pose. Reach towards your heels. Take 2 big, slow breaths, then gently lower your hips.</p>
